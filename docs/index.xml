      <description>Prerequisites You should be generally numerically literate, and some prior programming experience will be helpful. Students new to programming might find Hands on Programming with R to be helpful. Students with significant experience in programming and statistical analysis should find themselves well prepared but should find plenty still to learn in each lesson.
Instructional Methods As a flipped classroom, students are provided with either reading or video material that they are expected to view/read prior to class.</description>
